# Notes Sharing Platform

A full-stack web application where students can **upload**, **browse**, **search**, and **review** academic notes.

This project was collaboratively built by a team of 5 students from **Newton School of Technology**, under the guidance of faculty members and with support from the **Software Development Club (NST-SDC)**. What began as a summer open-source initiative for solving students **real-world problem** became a hands-on way to strengthen our skills in frontend, backend, databases, deployment, and teamwork.
